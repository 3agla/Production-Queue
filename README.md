# Production-Queue
A production Que for manufacturing lines.
This is a skeleton application that was created for a company that ended up backing out.
It is intended to take in a job number and then assign it to the working line.
When the job is assinged it will go into the Que of the line specified.
Once the line completes its work it will then add the completed job into a recently completed Que
and the next one in que will be in the production state.
Everytime a button is pressed it will automatically save the state of the app.
When the app is closed all data is erased and can be recovered by pressing the load button.
It will then put the app in the most recently saved state.

NOTE: The app was modifed to have a dull look due to copyrights for the company it was created for.
